# 2.4 DATA CLEANING AND MANIPULATION
To prepare the data for analysis, I used BigQuery to join all tables into a single dataset under the brand_id key. I combined product_name with description into one description variable, resulting in a cleaned and aggregated dataset. However, to analyze product category frequencies, I needed to extract string-specific data from the description column.

## 2.4.1 SQL
I created two variables: style_id and sub_style_id, and extracted them from description using REGEXP_EXTRACT() and Common Table Expressions (CTE) for aggregation. The first variable represented broad apparel categories such as jackets, coats, tracks, vests, etc., while the second variable identified specific properties such as materials or functions (e.g., down, shell, windstop, etc.). See the SQL query below.<BR></BR>

           • Insight 1 description <br></br>
           • Insight 2 Description <br></br>


```
WITH descrip_tbl AS -- replace decription_id CTE
(SELECT
  brand_id,
  product_name,
  REPLACE(product_name, 'Jkt', 'Jacket') AS description_id,
  
FROM data-analytics-course-413120.gda_course_8_data.outerwear_tbl
GROUP BY brand_id, product_name
),
style_tbl AS  -- Style_id CTE
(SELECT
  brand_id,
  product_name,
    REGEXP_EXTRACT(
    description_id,
    r'Jacket|Vest|Parka|Coat|Fleece|Anorak|Overcoat|
      Peacoat|Gilet|Track Top|Sweatshirt|Shacket|Overshirt'
  ) AS style_id
  FROM descrip_tbl
  GROUP BY brand_id, product_name, description_id
),
sub_style_tbl AS -- Sub_style_id CTE`
(SELECT
  brand_id,
  product_name,
    REGEXP_EXTRACT(
    product_name,
    r'Padded|Down|Linner|Puffer|Bomber|Varsity|Hoodie|Flight|Coach|
    Fleece|Shirt|Track|Packable|Nylon|Chore|Shell|Zip|Ripstop|GORE-TEX|
    Packable|Windrunner|Shearling|Quilted|Wool|Twill|Corduroy|Canvas|
    Flannel|WIP|Denim|Windbreaker|Primaloft®|Cotton|Hoodied|Leather'
  ) AS sub_style_id

FROM data-analytics-course-413120.gda_course_8_data.outerwear_tbl
GROUP BY brand_id, product_name
)
SELECT 
  berlin_ds.brand_id,
  descrip_tbl.description_id,
  style_tbl.style_id,
  sub_style_tbl.sub_style_id,
  berlin_ds.price  
FROM 
  data-analytics-course-413120.gda_course_8_data.outerwear_tbl AS berlin_ds 
  FULL OUTER JOIN descrip_tbl ON berlin_ds.product_name = descrip_tbl.product_name
  FULL OUTER JOIN style_tbl ON descrip_tbl.product_name = style_tbl.product_name
  FULL OUTER JOIN sub_style_tbl ON style_tbl.product_name = sub_style_tbl.product_name

GROUP BY brand_id,description_id, style_id, sub_style_tbl.sub_style_id, price
ORDER BY price DESC
```
## 2.4.2 DATA INTERGRATION
Below is the final dataset after the description variable was aggregated and the string data for ```style_id``` and ```sub_style_id``` were extracted. The dataset is now ready for analysis.
